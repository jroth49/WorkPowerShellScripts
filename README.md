# WorkPowerShellScripts
Some powershell scripts I utilize to help me automate my work at my help desk intern for Kelly Tractor Co. You can notice as I worked there my scripts progressively add on to each other. Eventually the last one is showing my total progress of automating the total process for encrypting Dell Computers by checking for a TPM Chip and rebooting.
